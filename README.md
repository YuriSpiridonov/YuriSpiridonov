### Hey there! My name is Yuri.

_Aspiring Developer_

I am a former mining engineer. Covid pandemic pushed me to the career change so I quit job to become a self-taught developer. Currently I am learning Data Structures & Algorithms and Data Analysis with Python. Besides that I am passionate about IoT and Data-driven technologies.
